4027,"Explain the use of Radio Frequency Ablation as a treatment PURPOSE OF REVIEW : Localized renal cell carcinoma has an excellent 5 - year survival when treated surgically. Apart from extirpative treatment, ablative techniques are becoming more popular to minimize patient morbidity. Clinically, radio frequency ablation and cryoablation can be performed percutaneously or laparoscopically. Oncological effectiveness of ablative techniques is encouraging as 3 - year data are emerging. Our review highlights the current literature demonstrating the effectiveness of cryoablation and radio frequency ablation performed laparoscopically or percutaneously. RECENT FINDINGS : Cryoablation performed laparoscopically or percutaneously offers excellent oncological outcomes with single - session therapy. With 3 - year cancer - specific survival of 98 %, laparoscopic cryoablation is safe and can be performed with minimal insult to overall renal function. Local recurrence rates and metastatic progression also seem to favor cryoablation over radio frequency ablation ( 4. 6 vs. 11. 7 % and 1. 2 vs. 2. 3 %, respectively ). Radio frequency ablation also offers similar survival rates ; however, re - treatment rates are higher ( 8. 8 % ). Radio frequency ablation also carries a higher rate of collecting system injuries when performed percutaneously. SUMMARY : Cryoablation and radio frequency ablation are effective treatment modalities for small renal masses in the infirm patient. Given patient and technical variability"

3480,"Does nintedanib hold promise for lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis? Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic lung disease with no clear etiology and a paucity of therapeutic options. Nintedanib ( previously known as BIBF 1120 ) is a tyrosine kinase receptor antagonist which inhibits a number of key receptors, including those for platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ), vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ), and fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ). These growth factors are profibrotic and each has been investigated as a potential standalone therapeutic target in IPF. Simultaneous inhibition of these receptors, with an analog of nintedanib, has proved to be effective in experimental animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. This observation, together with extensive safety and pharmacokinetic data from studies of nintedanib in malignancy, paved the way for the clinical development of this drug in IPF. The Phase IIb TOMORROW trial demonstrated that treatment with nintedanib may potentially slow decline in lung function, decrease the frequency of acute exacerbations, and improve quality of life in patients with IPF. While these observations are drawn from a single clinical trial, taken together with the preclinical data they suggest that nintedanib may yet become an important therapeutic option"

Prothymosin alpha ( ProTalpha ) is a small acidic polypeptide with important immunostimulatory properties, which we have previously shown to be exerted by its carboxyl ( C ) - terminus. It exerts immunoenhancing effects through stimulation of monocytes via toll - like receptor ( TLR ) triggering. Here, we assayed the activity of synthetic peptides homologous to ProTalpha's C - terminus to stimulate lymphocyte functions, in particular natural killer cell cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy donors. A synthetic decapeptide TKKQKTDEDD was identified as the most potent lymphocyte stimulator. The activity of this peptide was sequence - specific and comparable to that of the intact molecule, suggesting that ProTalpha's immunoactive segment encompasses the nuclear localization signal sequence of the polypeptide. Because ProTalpha stimulates immune responses in a monocyte - dependent manner, we further investigated whether the entire molecule and its peptide TKKQKTDEDD specifically act on monocytes and show that both can promote maturation of monocyte - derived dendritic cells ( DC ). Finally, knowing that, under specific conditions, ProTalpha forms amyloid fibrils, we studied the amyloidogenic properties"

The VHL tumour suppressor gene, responsible for the disease, encodes for a major regulator of the hypoxic response by targeting the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) for degradation. In this review, we present a synopsis of clinical features of the disease and emphasise unique aspects of VHL syndrome in the paediatric population. Genotype - phenotype associations based on the risk of phaeochromocytoma have pointed to the existence of additional, HIF - independent functions of VHL that remain underexplored. We also examine the progress on these pleiotropic roles of VHL, which contribute to explain clinical features of VHL disease.

In addition, normalization methods and statistical models are not exchangeable across the packages without adequate transformations the users are often not aware of. Thus, dedicated analysis pipelines are needed to include systematic quality control steps and prevent errors from misusing the proposed methods. RESULTS : SARTools"

Computational methods attempting to identify instances of cis - regulatory modules ( CRMs ) in the genome face a challenging problem of searching for potentially interacting transcription factor binding sites while knowledge of the specific interactions involved remains limited. Without a comprehensive comparison of their performance, the reliability and accuracy of these tools remains unclear. Faced with a large number of different tools that address this problem, we summarized and categorized them based on search strategy and input data requirements. Twelve representative methods were chosen and applied to predict CRMs from the Drosophila CRM database REDfly, and across the human ENCODE regions"

Active enhancers in mammals produce enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs ) that are bidirectionally transcribed, unspliced, and unstable. Enhancer regions are also enriched with long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA ) transcripts, which are typically spliced and substantially more stable. In order to explore the relationship between these two classes of RNAs, we analyzed DNase hypersensitive sites with evidence of bidirectional transcription, which we termed eRNA - producing centers ( EPCs ). EPCs found very close to transcription start sites of lncRNAs exhibit attributes of both enhancers and promoters, including distinctive DNA motifs and a characteristic chromatin landscape. These EPCs are associated with higher enhancer activity"

BACKGROUND : Wire closure still remains the preferred technique despite reasonable disadvantages. Associated complications, such as infection and sternal instability, cause time - and cost - consuming therapies. We present a new tool for sternal closure with its first clinical experience and results. METHODS : The sternal ZipFix ( TM ) System is based on the cable - tie principle. It primarily consists of biocompatible Poly - Ether - Ether - Ketone implants and is predominantly used peristernally through the intercostal space. The system provides a large implant - to - bone contact for better force distribution and for avoiding bone cut through. RESULTS : 50 patients were closed with the ZipFix ( TM ) system. No sternal instability was observed at 30 days. Two patients developed a mediastinitis that necessitated the removal of the device ; however, the ZipFix ( TM ) were intact and the sternum remained stable. CONCLUSIONS : In our initial evaluation, the short - term results have shown that the sternal ZipFix ( TM ) can be used safely and effectively. It is fast, easy to use and serves as a potential alternative for traditional wire closure"

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : The pharmacokinetic models that are applied to describe the disposition of therapeutic antibodies assume that the interaction between an antibody and its target takes place in the central compartment. However, an increasing number of therapeutic antibodies are directed towards soluble / mobile targets. A flawed conclusion can be reached if the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis assumes that the interaction between the therapeutic antibody and its target takes place in the central compartment. The objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of local versus systemic interactions between adalimumab and tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) - α in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ), identify localization of the site of adalimumab action and assess the efficacy of local ( intra - articular ) versus systemic adalimumab administration for treatment of RA. METHODS : The clinical and preclinical data on adalimumab and TNFα disposition were analysed using a pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation approach. The disposition of adalimumab and TNFα and the interaction between them at the individual compartments ( the synovial fluid of the affected joints, central and peripheral compartments ) following different routes of adalimumab administration were studied. RESULTS : Outcomes of modelling and simulation using the pharmacokinetic model developed indicate that adalimumab can efficiently permeate from the diseased joints to the central circulation"

This function of wild - type p53 as "" guardian of the genome "" is achieved at different levels, as a cell cycle checkpoint protein, halting the cell cycle upon DNA damage, and via a direct involvement in processes of DNA repair. Alternatively, p53 can induce apoptosis. Mutations in the p53 gene occur in about 50 % of all human tumors and eliminate the tumor suppressor functions of p53. However, many mutant p53 proteins have not simply lost tumor suppressor functions but have gained oncogenic properties which contribute to the progression of tumor cells to a more malignant phenotype. The molecular basis for this gain of function of mutant p53 is still unknown"

Mutations in the OPA1 gene are the prevailing cause of dominant optic atrophy, a hereditary disease in which progressive degeneration of the optic nerve can lead to blindness. Here we investigate the properties of the Mgm1 / OPA1 protein in mammalian cells.

We used a potent mGluR5 silent allosteric modulator ( SAM, BMS - 984923 ) to separate its well - known physiological role in glutamate signaling from a pathological role in mediating amyloid - β oligomer ( Aβo ) action. Binding of the SAM to mGluR5 does not change glutamate signaling but strongly reduces mGluR5 interaction with cellular prion protein ( PrPC ) bound to Aβo. The SAM compound prevents Aβo - induced signal transduction in brain slices and in an AD transgenic mouse model, the APPswe / PS1ΔE9 strain. Critically, 4 weeks of SAM treatment rescues memory deficits and synaptic depletion in the APPswe / PS1ΔE9 transgenic mouse brain. Our data show that mGluR5's role in Aβo - dependent AD phenotypes is separate from its role in glutamate signaling and silent allosteric modulation of mGluR5 has promise as a disease - modifying AD"

The recent success of genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) is now followed by the challenge to determine how the reported susceptibility variants mediate complex traits and diseases. Expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTLs ) have been implicated in disease associations through overlaps between eQTLs and GWAS signals. However, the abundance of eQTLs and the strong correlation structure ( LD ) in the genome make it likely that some of these overlaps are coincidental and not driven by the same functional variants. In the present study, we propose an empirical methodology, which we call Regulatory Trait Concordance ( RTC ) that accounts for local LD structure and integrates eQTLs and GWAS results in order to reveal the subset of association signals that are due to cis eQTLs. We simulate genomic regions of various LD patterns with both a single or two causal variants and show that our score outperforms SNP correlation metrics"

Recombinant adeno - associated viral vectors ( rAAV ) have now been used in several clinical trials to treat a variety of diseases, and are currently the preferred choice of many investigators in the field, due to both their low pathogenicity and immunogenicity compared with other viral vectors, as well as localized long - term gene expression, despite their limitations of DNA size packaging and speed of expression. Recently, a number of advances have led to new generations of rAAV vectors, with improved features. This review addresses the various strategies employed to such effect, namely exploring distinct serotype tropisms, the production of mosaic and chimeric capsids, the selection of vectors through directed evolution, the development of self - complementary vectors, the use of pharmacological adjuvants and the induction of specific capsid mutations. Such approaches are expected to help the establishment of rAAV - based clinical gene therapy"

We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms within ultraconserved elements ( UCEs ) are associated with susceptibility to overall colorectal cancer ( CRC ) and susceptibility to tumor site - specific CRC. The study included 787 CRC patients and 551 healthy controls. The study comprised of a training set ( 520 cases and 341 controls ) and a replication set ( 267 cases and 210 controls ). We observed associations in rs7849 and rs1399685 with CRC risk. For example, a dose - dependent trend ( per - allele odds ratio ( OR ), 0. 78 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ), 0. 63 - 1. 00 ; P for trend = 0. 05 ) associated with the variant allele of rs7849 in the training set. The significant trend toward a decrease in CRC risk was confirmed in the replication set ( per - allele OR, 0. 72 ; 95 % CI, 0. 52 - 0. 99 ; P for trend = 0. 044 ). When stratified by tumor location, for left - sided CRC ( LCRC ) risk, significant association was observed for the variant - containing genotypes of rs1399685 ( OR, 1. 77 ; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 3. 06 ) and the risk was replicated in the replication population ( OR, 2. 04 ; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 4. 07 ).

METHODS : A total of 169 patients with spinal metastases, treated in the Spine Unit of Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, from Jan. 2001 to Apr. 2004, were enrolled. The life expectancy was scored according to both Tomita system and Tokuhashi system before operation, the spinal metastases were classified according to Tomita system, and the patients underwent surgery accordingly. Follow - up was done 6, 12, and 24 months after operation. The precise of Tomita system and Tokuhashi system in estimating "" death within 3 months "", "" death within 6 months "", and "" death within 12 months "" was compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves ( ROC curves ). The mean survival time of the patients was calculated by Kaplan - Meier method. RESULTS : ROC curves of "" death within 3 months "", "" death within 6 months "", and "" death within 12 months "" showed no significant difference between Tomita score and Tokuhashi score in each group ( P = 0. 16, P = 0. 47, and P = 0. 38, respectively ). Kaplan - Meier survival curves showed that Tomita system overestimated the prognosis in scores from 4 to 7, and Tokuhashi system underestimated the prognosis in scores from 0 to 8. CONCLUSIONS : Both Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems could be used to predict prognosis of spinal metastases after operation"

Here, we report the results of epigenetic modifications in UV - exposed skin and skin tumors in a systematic manner. The skin and tumor samples were collected after chronic exposure of the skin of SKH - 1 hairless mice to UVB radiation using a well - established photocarcinogenesis protocol. We found a distinct DNA hypermethylation pattern in the UVB - exposed epidermal skin and UVB - induced skin tumors that was associated with the elevated expression and activity of the DNA methyltransferases ( Dnmt ) 1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. To explore the role of hypermethylation in skin photocarcinogenesis, we focused on the p16 ( INK4a ) and RASSF1A tumor suppressor genes, which are transcriptionally silenced on methylation. We established that the silencing of these genes in UVB - exposed epidermis and UVB - induced skin tumors is associated with a network of epigenetic modifications, including hypoacetylation of histone H3 and H4 and increased histone deacetylation, as well as recruitment of methyl - binding proteins, including MeCP2 and MBD1, to the methylated CpGs. Higher levels of DNA methylation and DNMT activity in human squamous cell carcinoma specimens than in normal human skin suggest that the data are relevant clinically. Our data indicate for the first time that UVB - induced DNA hypermethylation, enhanced Dnmt activity and histone modifications"

Craniospinal irradiation of a male phantom was calculated for passively - scattered and scanned - beam proton treatment units. Organ doses were estimated from treatment plans ; for the proton treatments, the amount of stray radiation was calculated separately using the Monte Carlo method. The organ doses were converted to risk of cancer incidence using a standard formalism developed for radiation protection purposes. The total lifetime risk of second cancer due exclusively to stray radiation was 1. 5 % for the passively scattered treatment versus 0. 8 %"

Physical activity reduces many major mortality risk factors including arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer. All - cause mortality is decreased by about 30 % to 35 % in physically active as compared to inactive subjects. The purpose of this paper was to synthesize the literature on life expectancy in relation to physical activity. A systematic PubMed search on life expectancy in physically active and inactive individuals was performed. In addition, articles comparing life expectancy of athletes compared to that of nonathletes were reviewed. Results of 13 studies describing eight different cohorts suggest that regular physical activity is associated with an increase of life expectancy by 0. 4 to 6. 9 years. Eleven studies included confounding risk factors for mortality and revealed an increase in life expectancy by 0. 4 to 4. 2 years with regular physical activity. Eleven case control studies on life expectancy in former athletes revealed consistently greater life expectancy in aerobic endurance athletes but inconsistent results for other athletes. None of these studies considered confounding risk factors for mortality. In conclusion, while regular physical activity increases life expectancy, it remains unclear if high - intensity sports activities further increase life expectancy"
